To a programmer, a system call looks like any other call to a library pro-
cedure. Is it important that a programmer know which library procedures result in
system calls? If so, why

No, a programmer does not necessarily have to know which library procedures result in system call. 
For example, web developer.  We know that system calls are handled in kernel mode which are both expensive 
and have significant impact on the running time. Therefore, it will affect performance. With understandings
on the operational system, programmers might not 
know how long it will take but can base on the request calls and made an educational guess.
