Two-level thread model is a combination of Many-to-Many and One-to-One
models. Describe a scenario that such a model outperforms both Many-to-Many and
One-to-One models. You can provide a general scenario or use an arbitrary application
program to explain your answer

My answer not sure
Background Information:
One-to-One model
-with the one to one model, a new kernel thread is created to handle 
each user thread which means more overhead which slows down the system.
The underlying implementation of the concurrency primitives affects whether, 
say, nonblocking IO or heavy threading is better. 
If you mix the two you can turn your concurrency solution to make the best use of the system you are running on.
